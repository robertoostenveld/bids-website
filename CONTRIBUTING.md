# Contributing to bids.neuroimaging.io

Welcome to the BIDS repository! We're excited you're here and want to contribute.  

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved. If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an [issue][link_issues]!

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

## Joining the community

BIDS is a growing community of neuroimaging enthusiasts, and we want to make our resources accessible to and engaging for as many researchers as possible.
We therefore require that all contributions adhere to our [Code of Conduct][link_code_of_conduct].

## Where to start: labels

The list of labels for current issues are [here][link_labels] and include:

* [![Help Wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-159818.svg)][link_helpwanted] *These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with.*

    If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues, we especially encourage you to do so!

* [![Requests](https://img.shields.io/badge/-requests-fbca04.svg)][link_requests] *These issues are asking for new features to be added to the project.*

    Please try to make sure that your requested feature is distinct from any others that have already been requested or implemented. If you find one that's similar but there are subtle differences please reference the other request in your issue.

## Making a change

We appreciate all contributions to BIDS, but those accepted fastest will follow a workflow similar to the following:

**1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition.**

This allows other members of the BIDS web development team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

**2. [Fork][link_fork] the [BIDS repository][link_bids] to your profile.**

This is now your own unique copy of bids.neuroimaging.io. Changes here won't effect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the master repository.

**3. Make the changes you've discussed.**

Try to keep the changes focused. If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new branch][link_branches].

**4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].**

A member of the development team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

## Recognizing contributions

BIDS follows the [all-contributors][link_allcontributors] specification, so we welcome and recognize all contributions from documentation to testing to code development.
You can see a list of current contributors in our [specification][link_bids_spec].

## Thank you!

You're awesome. :wave::smiley:
